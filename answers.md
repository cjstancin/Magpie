Keywords and Responses
candy- There's too many to choose. What's yours?
games- I'm that AI bot you play against in most games.
food- My favorite food is bleach.

When more than 1 keyword is in a string, the first keyword in the string is the response used. To prioritize responses, the if/else if statements need to change positions.

1. Know contains the word no, so the code will respond with "Why so negative?" even though the user never used no as a word. The same will happen with "smothered" because it has "mother" on the inside of it.
